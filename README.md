A tool for making AI Honeypot sites. 

AI bots that ignore instructions telling
them not to scrape content piss
me off. The goal of this project is
to build a tool that builds sites to 
poison the bad actors. The idea being
to deploy them on all those unused
domains you have laying around or
subdomains on existing sites.
